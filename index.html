    <h1>Motherboard</h1>
    <h2>
      A motherboard (also called mainboard, main circuit board, MB, mboard,
      backplane board, base board, system board, mobo; or in Apple computers
      logic board) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose
      computers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication
      between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the
      central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for
      other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains
      significant sub-systems, such as the central processor, the chipset's
      input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors, and other
      components integrated for general use. Motherboard means specifically a
      PCB with expansion capabilities. As the name suggests, this board is often
      referred to as the mother of all components attached to it, which often
      include peripherals, interface cards, and daughterboards: sound cards,
      video cards, network cards, host bus adapters, TV tuner cards, IEEE 1394
      cards, and a variety of other custom components. Similarly, the term
      mainboard describes a device with a single board and no additional
      expansions or capability, such as controlling boards in laser printers,
      television sets, washing machines, mobile phones, and other embedded
      systems with limited expansion abilities.

    <h1>CPU</h1>
    <h2>
      Acentral processing unit (CPU)—also called a central processor or main
      processor—is the most important processor in a given computer. Its
      electronic circuitry executes instructions of a computer program, such as
      arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations. This
      role contrasts with that of external components, such as main memory and
      I/O circuitry,[1] and specialized coprocessors such as graphics processing
      units (GPUs). The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed
      over time, but their fundamental operation remains almost unchanged.
      Principal components of a CPU include the arithmetic–logic unit (ALU) that
      performs arithmetic and logic operations, processor registers that supply
      operands to the ALU and store the results of ALU operations, and a control
      unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory), decoding and execution
      (of instructions) by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU,
      registers, and other components. Modern CPUs devote a lot of semiconductor
      area to caches and instruction-level parallelism to increase performance
      and to CPU modes to support operating systems and virtualization. Most
      modern CPUs are implemented on integrated circuit (IC) microprocessors,
      with one or more CPUs on a single IC chip. Microprocessor chips with
      multiple CPUs are multi-core processors. The individual physical CPUs,
      processor cores, can also be multithreaded to support CPU-level
      multithreading.[2] An IC that contains a CPU may also contain memory,
      peripheral interfaces, and other components of a computer; such integrated
      devices are variously called microcontrollers or systems on a chip (SoC).

    <h1>RAM</h1>
    <h2>
      Random-access memory (RAM; /ræm/) is a form of electronic computer memory
      that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working
      data and machine code.[1][2] A random-access memory device allows data
      items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective
      of the physical location of data inside the memory, in contrast with other
      direct-access data storage media (such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and
      the older magnetic tapes and drum memory), where the time required to read
      and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical
      locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as
      media rotation speeds and arm movement. RAM contains multiplexing and
      demultiplexing circuitry, to connect the data lines to the addressed
      storage for reading or writing the entry. Usually more than one bit of
      storage is accessed by the same address, and RAM devices often have
      multiple data lines and are said to be "8-bit" or "16-bit", etc.
      devices.[clarification needed] In today's technology, random-access memory
      takes the form of integrated circuit (IC) chips with MOS
      (metal–oxide–semiconductor) memory cells. RAM is normally associated with
      volatile types of memory where stored information is lost if power is
      removed. The two main types of volatile random-access semiconductor memory
      are static random-access memory (SRAM) and dynamic random-access memory
      (DRAM). Non-volatile RAM has also been developed[3] and other types of
      non-volatile memories allow random access for read operations, but either
      do not allow write operations or have other kinds of limitations on them.
      These include most types of ROM and a type of flash memory called
      NOR-Flash Use of semiconductor RAM dated back to 1965, when IBM introduced
      the monolithic (single-chip) 16-bit SP95 SRAM chip for their System/360
      Model 95 computer, and Toshiba used discrete DRAM memory cells for its
      180-bit Toscal BC-1411 electronic calculator, both based on bipolar
      transistors. While it offered higher speeds than magnetic-core memory,
      bipolar DRAM could not compete with the lower price of the then-dominant
      magnetic-core memory.[4] MOS memory, based on MOS transistors, was
      developed in the late 1960s, and was the basis for all early commercial
      semiconductor memory. The first commercial DRAM IC chip, the 1K Intel
      1103, was introduced in October 1970 Synchronous dynamic random-access
      memory (SDRAM) later debuted with the Samsung KM48SL2000 chip in 1992.

    <h1>GPU</h1>
    <h2>A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit initially designed to accelerate computer graphics and image processing (either on a video card or embedded on motherboards, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles). After their initial design, GPUs were found to be useful for non-graphic calculations involving embarrassingly parallel problems due to their parallel structure. Other non-graphical uses include the training of neural networks and cryptocurrency mining.

    <h1>HDD</h1>
    <H2>A hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive, or fixed disk,[a] is an electro-mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage with one or more rigid rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces.[1] Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order. HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data when powered off.[2][3][4] Modern HDDs are typically in the form of a small rectangular box.

        Hard disk drives were introduced by IBM in 1956,[5] and were the dominant secondary storage device for general-purpose computers beginning in the early 1960s. HDDs maintained this position into the modern era of servers and personal computers, though personal computing devices produced in large volume, like mobile phones and tablets, rely on flash memory storage devices. More than 224 companies have produced HDDs historically, though after extensive industry consolidation, most units are manufactured by Seagate, Toshiba, and Western Digital. HDDs dominate the volume of storage produced (exabytes per year) for servers. Though production is growing slowly (by exabytes shipped[6]), sales revenues and unit shipments are declining, because solid-state drives (SSDs) have higher data-transfer rates, higher areal storage density, somewhat better reliability,[7][8] and much lower latency and access times.[9][10][11][12]
        
        The revenues for SSDs, most of which use NAND flash memory, slightly exceeded those for HDDs in 2018.[13] Flash storage products had more than twice the revenue of hard disk drives as of 2017.[14] Though SSDs have four to nine times higher cost per bit,[15][16] they are replacing HDDs in applications where speed, power consumption, small size, high capacity and durability are important.[11][12] As of 2019, the cost per bit of SSDs is falling, and the price premium over HDDs has narrowed.[16]
        
        The primary characteristics of an HDD are its capacity and performance. Capacity is specified in unit prefixes corresponding to powers of 1000: a 1-terabyte (TB) drive has a capacity of 1,000 gigabytes, where 1 gigabyte = 1 000 megabytes = 1 000 000 kilobytes (1 million) = 1 000 000 000 bytes (1 billion). Typically, some of an HDD's capacity is unavailable to the user because it is used by the file system and the computer operating system, and possibly inbuilt redundancy for error correction and recovery. There can be confusion regarding storage capacity, since capacities are stated in decimal gigabytes (powers of 1000) by HDD manufacturers, whereas the most commonly used operating systems report capacities in powers of 1024, which results in a smaller number than advertised. Performance is specified as the time required to move the heads to a track or cylinder (average access time), the time it takes for the desired sector to move under the head (average latency, which is a function of the physical rotational speed in revolutions per minute), and finally, the speed at which the data is transmitted (data rate).
        
        The two most common form factors for modern HDDs are 3.5-inch, for desktop computers, and 2.5-inch, primarily for laptops. HDDs are connected to systems by standard interface cables such as SATA (Serial ATA), USB, SAS (Serial Attached SCSI), or PATA (Parallel ATA) cables.</H2>
        
        <H1>SSD</H1>
        <h2>A solid-state drive (SSD) is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently, typically using flash memory, and functions as secondary storage in the hierarchy of computer storage.[1] It is also sometimes called a semiconductor storage device, a solid-state device, or a solid-state disk,[2] even though SSDs lack the physical spinning disks and movable read-write heads used in hard disk drives (HDDs) and floppy disks.[3] SSD also has rich internal parallelism for data processing.[4]

            In comparison to hard disk drives and similar electromechanical media which use moving parts, SSDs are typically more resistant to physical shock, run silently, and have higher input/output rates and lower latency.[5] SSDs store data in semiconductor cells. As of 2019, cells can contain between 1 and 4 bits of data. SSD storage devices vary in their properties according to the number of bits stored in each cell, with single-bit cells ("Single Level Cells" or "SLC") being generally the most reliable, durable, fast, and expensive type, compared with 2- and 3-bit cells ("Multi-Level Cells/MLC" and "Triple-Level Cells/TLC"), and finally, quad-bit cells ("QLC") being used for consumer devices that do not require such extreme properties and are the cheapest per gigabyte (GB) of the four. In addition, 3D XPoint memory (sold by Intel under the Optane brand) stores data by changing the electrical resistance of cells instead of storing electrical charges in cells, and SSDs made from RAM can be used for high speed, when data persistence after power loss is not required, or may use battery power to retain data when its usual power source is unavailable.[6] Hybrid drives or solid-state hybrid drives (SSHDs), such as Intel's Hystor[7] and Apple's Fusion Drive, combine features of SSDs and HDDs in the same unit using both flash memory and spinning magnetic disks in order to improve the performance of frequently-accessed data.[8][9][10] Bcache achieves a similar effect purely in software, using combinations of dedicated regular SSDs and HDDs.
            
            SSDs based on NAND flash will slowly leak charge over time if left for long periods without power. This causes worn-out drives (that have exceeded their endurance rating) to start losing data typically after one year (if stored at 30 °C) to two years (at 25 °C) in storage; for new drives it takes longer.[11] Therefore, SSDs are not suitable for archival storage. 3D XPoint is a possible exception to this rule; it is a relatively new technology with unknown long-term data-retention characteristics.
            
            SSDs can use traditional HDD interfaces and form factors, or newer interfaces and form factors that exploit specific advantages of the flash memory in SSDs. Traditional interfaces (e.g. SATA and SAS) and standard HDD form factors allow such SSDs to be used as drop-in replacements for HDDs in computers and other devices. Newer form factors such as mSATA, M.2, U.2, NF1/M.3/NGSFF,[12][13] XFM Express (Crossover Flash Memory, form factor XT2)[14] and EDSFF (formerly known as Ruler SSD)[15][16] and higher speed interfaces such as NVM Express (NVMe) over PCI Express (PCIe) can further increase performance over HDD performance.[6] SSDs have a limited lifetime number of writes, and also slow down as they reach their full storage capacity.</h2>
